# ARKTabe

Also called the ARK Effort Calculator, is a fairly simple algorithmn I developed to determine the best material to XP ratio throughout the game, the only snag in such system is the simple fact that there is no set amount of effort you need to put fourth to get any one item. 

That's where the user comes in! Currently you go through constants and change the value in mats, which will change the calculations and you can go through it to your liking!


NOTES: A couple things are considered the same (Metal Ingots, Iron Ingots, Scrap Metal/Iron Ingot) I'm aware of stuff like this, but for the sake of argument I decided that if someone cared enough to fix it, then thats okay! I just considered it insignificant enough to warrant no change, Oh also im aware going from dict to Enum to dict is pretty trash... I didn't bother to fix it 

Thanks so much to Akia Vongdara for the data table! I was definitely too lazy to make my own scraper!
